%% This file sets up the Sign and Label datatypes and creates Sign and
%% Label macros.
%%
%% Signs generally represent interesting parts of game area, usually
%% as things posted on walls.  Labels represent other things, often on
%% or inside envelopes, that are part of complex mechanics.
%%
%% The default value for \MYloc will inherit location from the Place
%% or Sign most immediately up the ownership tree.  Override this by
%% setting \MYloc to anything (even blank).
%%
%% Sign is for full-sized signs that would cover most of a large
%% manila envelope; SignMedium is for signs sized to half-sized manila
%% envelopes; SignSmall is for signs sized for small manila envelopes
%% (the same size as item cards).  Label, LabelMedium, and LabelSmall
%% are analagous, but they don't have a \takedownby note at the
%% bottom.  You can always use a sign or label without an envelope or
%% with a differently-sized envelope.  Choose which based on
%% visibility and content.
%%
%% SignTiny is for signs you want to be hard to find; it is small and
%% does not have a \takedownby note.  SignDot is for a very small
%% "dot" which only has a title.
%%
%% SignStrip produces a strip of paper (without a \takedownby note)
%% with labels on the outside that show on both sides if you fold it
%% in half.  These are a convenient alternative to sub-envelopes. They
%% can also be used for "s-packets" taped to walls (see
%% Extras/README-s-packets).
%%
%% LabelCover produces a label similar to the cover to a research
%% notebook.  LabelPage, likewise, produces a page.
%%
%% EOG is for full-sized end-of-game signs.

\NEW{Sign}{\sLibraryDesc}{
  \s\MYname	{The Main Library of Wax-Chandler University}
  \s\MYtext	{The main library of Wax-Chandler University is one of the largest buildings on campus. It is faced in marble of many colors, unlike most of the other old buildings on campus (which are tudor style). Friezes all around the building depict other great libraries through history, including of course Alexandria. The statues and gargoyles that dot the roof line are exquisitely carved, and each one has one or more details done in bronze, turned green by the passage of time. The front doors are made of local Cedar wood - an unusual choice to be sure, but somehow they suit the building perfectly.
	
	The library is divided into the public areas and the stacks. Years ago the stacks used to be open, but after one too many students were found with gaunt, hollow eyes, and no recollection of what year it was, the Administration elected to close most of the collection. Now only trained librarians, and the small gremlins that care-take the library, are allowed to retrieve books from the stacks. Still, the public area of the library on the first floor is tastefully appointed, with plenty of tables for serious study, and couches and arm-chairs for more leisurely pursuits. A dozen small conference rooms are clustered along the east wall to allow for group studying. A number of display cases are set up along the west wall. The items on display rotate frequently between the many rare and unique pieces in the library's collection.
	
	There is no consensus on where the gremlins came from, but there is no arguing that they are here. Their number seems to vary widely. Some days you can't sigh heavily without one of them appearing at your elbow to ``shush'' you, and another appearing to ask if they can help somehow. Other times, the librarians will go days between finding evidence of their presence anywhere in the library. The preferred hypothesis is that due to the concentration of magic in the library from the collection, the stacks have become nigh endless, and when the gremlins are missing from the public areas, they are off somewhere in deep in the stacks, dealing with some threat or danger that has emerged.
	
	\emph{In the Library, you can usually expect to find the Head Librarian. You can start research via the research mechanic here. You may also find rare books on display that have interesting secrets to discover.}

The staircase has no hand-rail, and goes up to the very top of the 5 story structure. The climb is dizzying and nerve-wracking, but the view from the top is worth it. From the landing at the top, you can see the whole of campus, and a fair ways out into the surrounding town and forest.
	
	In the tower hangs the renowned Cloche Bell, a massive bronze bell, forged by Brendan Cloche, one of the University Founders. The University Bell-warden is responsible for maintaining the bell and ensuring that the bell rings to mark the hour. The bell tower has never been fitted with an electronic system; the bell is still rung by hand every hour from 5 am to 11 pm.
	
	Rumors abound of the ghost of Brendan Cloche haunting the tower, and anecdotal evidence that the bell sometimes rings of it's own accord certainly help reinforce those rumors.}

\emph{The bell is made of pure bronze and was forged and cast in a bell furnace right here on campus in 1937. The bell's casting proved almost beyond the skill of Brendan Cloche, one of the founders of the University, and Wax Chandlerâ€™s first metallurgist. He tried twice to cast the massive bell, only to have it crack when it was released from the mold.  according to local legend, his third attempt was made of even greater tragedy. While working late into the night Cloche purportedly slipped and fell into the molten metal in the mold. It was only at the uncompromising insistence of the only remaining founder, Piper of the Forest, that the bell's forging was completed, and the bell hung in the tower.}
